# Vehicle Dynamics Modelling & Simulation (MATLAB/Simulink)

## ðŸ“Œ Overview
This project was created to build confidence in **modelling and simulation** using **MATLAB/Simulink**.  
It focuses on vehicle dynamics, specifically tyre modelling and bicycle model representation.  

The project is **work in progress** and will be updated as more features and refinements are added.
